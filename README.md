# **Instructor Attendance system**  
-> This backend uses Node.js and MongoDB as database with Mongoose ODM.  
-> Implemented logic for checkin and checkout. When the respective API's are hit, logs are made accordingly.  
-> Added Admin role for users  
-> Added postman collection to the repository for testing purposes  

**To run the project:**  
Clone the repo.  
Commands:  
1) npm install  
2) npm start
Database will connect to my mongodb instance for now as I have whitelisted all IP's for the time being.
